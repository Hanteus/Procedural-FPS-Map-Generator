Let's start! For now I'll follow the "Procedural cave generation tutorial" by Sebastian League. Then I'll start implementing my stuff. I have to create a 3D level strating from a text representation of it. Then I'll add a FPS character controller and implement 2/3 weapons, power ups, medkits, ammunitions and a dummy target.

I've finished implementing the example, now I need to modify it. I can:
- Learn tiles, mesh, ecc.
- Scale tileAmount and use it as parameter.
- Add the floor collider.
- Square size as parameter.
- Add masks to the map generator, in this way I should be able to generate both natural and artificial levels. 
- The masks could be stored in a separate object?
- Color schemes stored in a separate object? Yes, use a Level Appearence Manager which stores the colors of the level and the height of the walls.
- Add more char.
- Library script which contains the list of all the extra tile with interactive elements.
- Extra char menaged by a separate script?
- Create the PrefabGenerator builder.

Rocket launcher, AK47, shotgun and rifle models done.

I've added normals to the map mesh. Medkit, spawner and target models done. Some models need some fixes tho.

I've learned a lot of stuff about meshes, models, ecc., I've solved the (fake) ligthing problem and I've implemented the possibility to add custom tiles.

I've done to much stuff to write it down. Check the commits.
